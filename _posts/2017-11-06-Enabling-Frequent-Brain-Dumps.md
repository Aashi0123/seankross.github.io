> Short version: Check out my sub-blog called [Notes](http://seankross.com/notes/).

One of the goals I had when I started this blog was to just put more of what I
do online. However over time I've noticed that in order for me to feel like an
idea is "worthy" of a blog post it has to be at least either well-polished or
inherently interesting. There are problems with both of these criteria:
well-polished work takes a significant amount of time which I don't always have,
and work that I think is uninteresting could be useful to others.
David Robinson illustrated this idea beautifully in a recent talk:

Snippets of code, figures, and thoughts that are stuck on my computer have no
chance of being helpful to anyone else! Therefore in
order to post more mundane content more often without diminishing the posts on
Postcards I'm starting a sub-blog called [Notes](http://seankross.com/notes/).
My goal with notes is to leave fewer ideas and slices of code "on the cutting
room floor" with the additional benefit of being able to develop ideas which
may lead to other posts or projects. Here are three recent notes that might
interest you:

- [Grouped Comparisons Graph](http://seankross.com/notes/grouped-comparisons-graph/)
  - Making quick grouped bar graphs in ggplot2.
- [Data Science from Scratch](http://seankross.com/notes/data-science-from-scratch/)
  - Tips for breaking into R-flavored data science.
- [Lagging Variables Within Groups](http://seankross.com/notes/lagging-variables-within-groups/)
  - Fun with lagging variables with dplyr.

Thanks to [Oliver Keyes](https://ironholds.org/links/) and of course
[David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob) for the inspiration!
