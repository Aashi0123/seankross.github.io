<p class="lead">GitHub Pages: A Love Story</p>

The static web has made a comeback in recent years and I think that some of the credit should go to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The feeling of being able to concentrate on writing without having to worry about configuration or content management is a blissful one. This site requires some overhead of course: the static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) has been a pleasure to set up. Jekyll is written in Ruby so it's easily entensible, and you can have a blog up and running with just one configuration file (and some posts of course). 

I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the layout and general design of this site, with the Twitter and GitHub logos in the bottom right serving as my biggest personal additions. Combining these three technologies strikes a great balance of control and automation for me. It's nice to finally have a place to call my own on the web.
