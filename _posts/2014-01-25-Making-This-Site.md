This site was built using three core technologies: [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for free hosting and version control, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for actually rendering the site, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for design. Let me explain a little about these technologes in case you're unfamiliar.

Throw all of your HTML, CSS, and Javascript into a Git repository and GitHub Pages will host it for free forever!
