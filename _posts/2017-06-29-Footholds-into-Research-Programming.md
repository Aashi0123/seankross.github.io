> Short version of this post: I wrote a book called The Unix Workbench as an
introduction to research programming. You can buy the book
[on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/unix/) (pay what you want including free) or 
you can [read the book online](http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/).

A thousand research programmers are born every day when they realize that some
goal that they would like to accomplish with a computer can not be achieved by
using Excel alone. Suddenly they're thrown into the overwhelming world of
programming, groping their way through Google searches and
[fighting with their apathetic computer](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm).
Eventually, hopefully, they find a foothold - some tiny system or process that
they can use, understand, and manipulate. 

I would like to direct students to these footholds as quickly as possible but
I'm usually unsatisfied with the resources that are available - especially for getting
started. After teaching many students I started to identify a baseline of
computing skills that I believe research programmers should have. The collection
of those skills became the basis of my new book: *The Unix Workbench*.

I have several goals in writing this book. First I wanted to provide this
material with a linear and understandable
narrative and a logical path from casual computer user to budding research
programmer. The book is licensed [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
meaning that anybody can modify, adapt, and share the book however they would
like. The source files for the book are
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench) and the book
teaches readers how to use Git and GitHub, so I'm interested in interacting with
readers of the book through GitHub. There have been countless times when I
wished that I could reach into a textbook to change something or to add a note,
so I hope that this book will empower readers to do that. Ultimately I set out
to write the introductory book that I would have wanted when I was learning how
to use the command line.

The book is available for purchase [on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/unix/) or
you can browse the book [online](http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/). If
you have any thoughts or feedback about the book the best way to get in touch
with me is on [Twitter @seankross](https://twitter.com/seankross).
