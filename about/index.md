# About Me

Hi! I'm Sean. In the past I attended NYU and the University of Maryland. 
Currently I live in Fells Point in Baltimore. I spend most of my time writing 
code, taking pictures, and reading books. If you're interested in what I've been
reading lately see the [supplementary materials](supplementary-materials.html).

# Talks

- Joint Statistical Meetings 2017, [Slides](http://seankross.com/jsm-talk/), [Blog Post](http://seankross.com/2017/08/11/Beyond-Axes-Simulating-Systems-with-Interactive-Graphics.html)
- Dataverse Community Meeting 2017, [Slides](http://seankross.com/iqss-talk/), [Blog Post](http://seankross.com/2017/06/19/Turning-Researcher-Fatigue-into-Puppy-Fatigue.html)
- The computing club at the Johns Hopkins School of Public health kindly invited
me to give a talk about a a topic of my choosing so I rambled on about
interaction design for data and modeling. These slides are unexciting, they're
mostly links to amazing work other folks have done which I demonstrated as
a means to try to inspire the audience. [Slides here](http://seankross.com/data-interaction-talk/).
- I spoke to members of the GIS community at [The University of Pennsylvania's
Institute for Urban Design](http://penniur.upenn.edu/) at their GIS Day 2016
celebration. [Slides and notes here](https://github.com/seankross/gisday).
- I gave a talk about [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) at the 2016 Seminário 
Internacional de Estatística com R. [Slides here](http://seankross.com/notes/swirltalk/).
