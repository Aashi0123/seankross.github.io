Data science is roughly split up into four areas:

1. Programming
2. Statistics
3. Communication
4. Domain Expertise. 

This document details how to get started with the first three. This is a very
R-centric guide because I live an R-centric life. Free resources are strongly
favorred because I'm a graduate student.

## Programming

Programming allows you to articulate yourself in the dimension of computational
action. Serious programmers are taken seriously, so you should aim to become
one.

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by
[Zed Shaw](https://twitter.com/zedshaw). Thousands of people have used this
book to learn hwo to code for the first time. Teaches you many fundamental
programming concepts, and Python is an essential language to know for anyone
who writes code.
- [The Unix Workbench](http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/) by
[me](https://twitter.com/seankross). A book I wrote for beginners about how to
use the command line, another baseline skill for a data scientist. Read to the
end of the third chapter before starting Learn Python the Hard Way, then come
back if you feel like you want more command line skills.
- [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)
by [Roger Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng). Learn R deeply to really start
your journey towards specializing as a data scientist.
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by 
[Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) and
[Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/StatGarrett). Modern data scientific
paradigms applied in R based in the philosophy of
[Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html).

## Statistics

Statistics will help you quantify uncertainly. 90% of what you need to
understand falls into the following four categories:

1. Probability and Combinatorics
2. The Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem
3. Regression
4. The Bootstrap

- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) by
[David Diez](https://twitter.com/OpenIntroOrg) and
[Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://twitter.com/minebocek). If you took one or
fewer statistics coursese in college, or if you just need a stats refresher
start here.
- [Regression Models for Data Science in R](https://leanpub.com/regmods) by
[Brian Caffo](https://twitter.com/bcaffo). Linear and generalized linear models
solve 80% of problems and their results are interpretable. They're the bread
and butter model for any data scientist.
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
by [Trevor Hastie](), [Robert Tibshirani](), and [Jerome Friedman](). My favorite
introduction to machine learning.
