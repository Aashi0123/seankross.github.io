There are 6 possible configurations of the cylinder. A "B" represents a bullet
and an "E" represents an empty chamber. The 6 configurations are:

1. BBEEEE
2. BEEEEB
3. EBBEEE
4. EEBBEE
5. EEEBBE
6. EEEEBB

Imagine the first letter is the chamber first aligned with the barrel. We know
we are not in configuration 1 or 2 since no bullet was fired on the first pull
of the trigger. That leaves four configurations remaining. We pulled the trigger
once, so the second letter now represents the chamber aligned with the barrel.
Since there is a bullet in the second chamber in only configuration 3, we know
the probability that a bullet will be fired with the next pull of the trigger is
0.25.
