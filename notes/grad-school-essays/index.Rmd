I applied to graduate school in the Winter of 2016 to start in the Fall of 2017
with the intention to study human-computer interaction, research programming,
and online learning. I was accepted to the PhD in Information at the University
of Michigan and the PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of California
San Diego. I was also rejected from many programs. Below are my personal
statements from the programs where I was accepted. I **do not feel** that any
of these essays are generally good examples of my writing, but perhaps they can
help someone somewhere.

- University of Michigan School of Information
    - [Academic Statement of Purpose](UMStatementofPurpose.pdf)
    - [Personal Statement](UMPersonalStatement.pdf)
- University of California San Diego Cognitive Science
    - [Statement of Purpose](UCSDStatementofPurpose.pdf)

After applying to UC San Diego [my eventual advisor](http://pgbovine.net/)
encouraged me to also apply to the PhD in Computer Science and he commented on
how *long* my personal statement was for Cognitive Science. This freaked me out
so I wrote a much shorter personal statement which is linked below. I was
rejected from the PhD but accepted to the MS program.

- University of California San Diego Computer Science
    - [Statement of Purpose](ShortPersonalStatement.pdf)

In the Winter of 2015 I applied and was accepted to the Ohio State University
for the MS in Biostatistics program. The personal essay I applied with is
below. I ended up not attending OSU, instead I accepted a position as the Chief
Technology Officer at the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab.

**Silly side note**: I love college football and I wonder if I'm one of the
only people in history to have applied to and been accepted to both Ohio State
and Michigan **and** to have chosen other options over both. Or expressed at an
emojiquation: ü§î (üê¶ > üå∞) ‚à© (üî± > „ÄΩÔ∏è)
