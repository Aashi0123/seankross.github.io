I have been coming across several great data visualizations about Germany
and German-related subjects. I am starting to collect them here.

- [Mapping German Dialects](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2018/03/categorical-spatial-interpolation-with-r/) by [Timo Grossenbacher](https://twitter.com/grssnbchr). His entire
[site](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/) is great.
- [Do you remember where the wall divided Berlin?](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berliner-mauer/) in the Berliner Morgenpost.
- [A rusting fountain of youth in Germany](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-rustingfountain/) by
[Lisa Charlotte Rost](https://twitter.com/lisacrost) who also maintains a
fantastic [site](http://lisacharlotterost.de/).
