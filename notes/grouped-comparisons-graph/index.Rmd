Thanks to [Tricia Ngoon](https://tngoon.github.io/) for inspiring the creation
of this graph. We were trying to compare multiple metrics between a control and
treatment group.

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)

data <- tribble(
  ~condition, ~taste, ~value,
  "Control", "Spicy", 56,
  "Treatment", "Spicy", 60,
  "Control", "Sweet", 68,
  "Treatment", "Sweet", 71,
  "Control", "Tangy", 83,
  "Treatment", "Tangy", 98,
  "Control", "All", 30,
  "Treatment", "All", 53
)

ggplot(data, aes(fct_inorder(taste), value)) +   
  geom_bar(aes(fill = condition), position = "dodge", stat="identity") +
  labs(x = "Taste", y = "Percentage of Answers")

ggplot(data, aes(fct_inorder(condition), value)) +   
  geom_bar(aes(fill = taste), position = "dodge", stat="identity") +
  labs(x = "Taste", y = "Percentage of Answers")

```
