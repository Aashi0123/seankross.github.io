Every once in a while I come across a friend's blog post where they're writing
some code that just doesn't look pretty on mobile. Here's an example from a
recent post on this blog:

<img style="max-height:40%" src="ugly.png">

The way the text wraps around just looks yucky to me. Thankfully there's a
solution! Make it possible for your code blocks to scroll from side to side
by adding the following to your CSS:

```css
pre code {
  overflow: auto;
  word-wrap: normal;
  white-space: pre;
}
```

Then gaze upon the resulting beauty:

<img style="max-height:40%" src="beautiful.png">

If you want to add this feature to a simple R Markdown document, you can put
the code above in a file called `styles.css`, then you can use it in your
document with the following yaml front matter:

```yaml

output: 
  html_document:
    css: styles.css

```
