The `while` loop is a sometimes controversial programming construct since
it is often not clear that the loop will ever end. Here's one situation where
I think it is appropriate to use. In this example I would like to generate a
small dataset with a high correlation coefficient ($r > 0.9$) and a significant
p-value for the correlation ($p < 0.05$). In order to do this I just keep
generating random datasets until I find one that satisfies my criteria. This is
certainly a non-elegant brute-force approach, but it gets the job done. I use
this approach when I'm trying to generate a "true positive" plot to 
illustrate the concept of using a 
[line up](http://had.co.nz/stat645/graphical-inference.pdf)
for graphical inference.

```{r, fig.asp=1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

set.seed(2018-02-01)

n <- 10

data <- data_frame(x = runif(n),
           y = runif(n))

test <- cor.test(data$x, data$y)

while(!(test$p.value < 0.05 && abs(test$estimate) > 0.9)) {
  data$x <- runif(n)
  data$y <- runif(n)
  test <- cor.test(data$x, data$y)
}

plot(data, xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), asp = 1)
```
