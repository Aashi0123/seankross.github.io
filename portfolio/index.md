Below I've listed a series of projects that I'm proud of. I think this is a 
fairly representative sample of how I work and what I'm interested in working
on. Please contact me at smk240 [at] gmail [dot] com if you have any questions.

### Swirl 

Swirl is an R package that teaches R programming and statistics interactively 
through the R console. Anyone can easily create and distribute their own Swirl 
courses.

- Project site: [swirlstats.com](http://www.swirlstats.com). 
- See my contributions the Swirl on [GitHub](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl). 
- I've also contributed several 
[Swirl courses](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses).

### Warppipe

Warppipe is an R package for munging through taxonomic annotations developed
during my time working in Mihai Pop's laboratory. My goal with Warpipe is to
turn it into a set of tools for an end-to-end annotation pipeline, allowing 
users to compare different annotations, pull taxonomies from several databases,
and generate statistics about distributions of bit scores within an annotation.

### Flex

Flex is a collection of Python tools used for a project I worked on in a
graduate course in computational genomics. Flex facilitates the experimental
use of multiple sequence alignment tools (in this case 
[Muscle](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/)) for finding consensus sequences from 
reads generated by the Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing process.

### Lego

Sharing data with scientists and the public is more important than ever for
creating reproducible scientific analysis. I believe that R data packages are a
great way to document and share a dataset. Tools for code documentation like
[Roxygen](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) can be used for data 
documentation, and loading a dataset from an R data package is as easy as using 
the `library()` function. I created `lego` as an exercise in writing R data 
packages. The dataset contains every Lego set manufactured from 1970 to 2014,
including information like the number of pieces per set, the price of each set,
and the number of minifigures per set.
